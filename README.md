# coins
This repository contains all of the images used for the Aeolian Alexanders die study. The format is the following:
1. Obverse dies = coinnumber_o.png
2. Reverse dies = coinnumber_r.png

Image quality and legibility vary tremendously; this is an effect of the different sources and materials used to gather them. Some are born digital, while others are scans of copies which were pasted to notecards decades ago.
